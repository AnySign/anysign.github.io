**We are AnySign**, a global team committed to advancing accessibility into action. We believe that the tech community
should serve vital social needs. By uniting technological innovation with real-world accessibility challenges, we ensure
that advancements in technology enrich everyone's lives.

**Our Mission Encompasses Two Core Objectives:** social services and tech developments.

On the social services front, we sponsor the accessibility of international conferences, advocating for open
collaboration and channeling the voices of real users directly to tech developers.
Notably, we supported [MobiCom'23](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2023/)
and [CPS-IoT Week'24](https://cps-iot-week2024.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).
Additionally, we are proactive in hosting events for deaf-hearing dialogues to deepen our understanding of the diverse
backgrounds and cultures of various communities.

In our research efforts, we engage in-depth with sign language users, gathering valuable datasets and tirelessly
innovating tech solutions to address pressing challenges. Our goal is not just technological advancement but creating
meaningful change that enhances lives.
