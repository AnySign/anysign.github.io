**Welcome to AnySign,** a global team dedicated to turning accessibility into action. We believe the tech community should address crucial social needs. By integrating technological innovation with real-world accessibility challenges, we ensure that technological advancements benefit everyone.



**Our Mission Focuses on Two Core Objectives: Social Services and Technological Advancement.**

In **Social Services**, we sponsor the accessibility of international conferences, advocating for open
collaboration and channeling the voices of real users directly to tech developers.
Notably, we supported [MobiCom'23](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2023/)
and [CPS-IoT Week'24](https://cps-iot-week2024.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).
Additionally, we are proactive in hosting events for deaf-hearing dialogues to deepen our understanding of the diverse
backgrounds and cultures of various communities.

In our **Research Efforts**, we engage in-depth with sign language users, gathering valuable datasets and tirelessly
innovating tech solutions to address pressing challenges. Our goal is not just technological advancement but creating
meaningful change that enhances lives.

**Meet Our Team of Diverse Experts.** Our multidisciplinary team, including specialists in linguistics, sign language, AI/AR/IoT systems, and communication studies, collaborates closely with Deaf communities worldwide.

**Supported by Leaders in Innovation,** our research has garnered backing from several research labs,
the [OpenAI Startup Fund](https://www.openai.fund/), and [AWS Startups](https://aws.amazon.com/startups). We are eager
to collaborate with individuals and teams who share our vision and mission. If you are interested in tackling projects
that can make a positive impact, please reach out to us at [contact@anysign.net](mailto:contact@anysign.net).
